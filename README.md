Game Engine Created by Marc Peregrina Parera

## Description


I'm currently working on a game engine project using OpenGL and C++, along with libraries like GLFW, glm, and assimp. The engine is designed around the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern, and I'm using assimp to manage 3D assets. To improve debugging, I've integrated glad and ImGui for a smoother user interface.

It's a learning adventure and a chance to experiment. I want to create a basic game engine that handles rendering, input, and asset management. Along the way, I'm discovering more about graphics and game development. I also hope to use this engine to build a simple game. It's all about learning, and having a personal workspace to create shaders
